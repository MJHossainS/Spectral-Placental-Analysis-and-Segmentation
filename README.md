# Spectral-Placental-Analysis-and-Segmentation
This repo contains Vgg16-UNet model for segmenting 37 channel hyperspectral images. Pre-trained Vgg16 on ImageNet with transfer learning handles small datasets. Batch normalization, dropout, Adam optimization for training with fixed image size. Improved results for fully supervised model.
